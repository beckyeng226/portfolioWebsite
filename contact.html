       <h2>About Me</h2>
       <h4>
        <p>In the spring of 2019, I decided to change career directions and become a programmer.  
            I spent several months taking online courses trying to narrow down what I wanted to do.  
            After taking several HTML/CSS courses, I muddled through the design and development of my first 
            website.  I learned a LOT, including how much I <em>didn't</em> know, but I also enjoyed it tremendously.  
            I decided to continue expanding my learning to include JavaScript, and I'm currently working my way through the 
            Full-Stack Developer Path at Codecademy, which I plan to complete in the Spring of 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I leave my laptop, I enjoy outdoor activities like hiking, camping, and biking.  
            I train and teach at an all-female karate dojo, where I am working towards my black belt.
            The geek in me loves to assemble puzzles (Star Wars Photomosaics are my favorite challenge), 
            solve word and math puzzles/games, and read.  
            I also enjoy knitting and crocheting to relax.
        </p>
